                        <p>TangMaru is the best Korean restaurant in the Tri-Cities! My boyfriend and I love visting whenever we have 
                        a craving for hot soups. Highly recommend!</p>

                        <p>Super tasty food and fast service. Also very close to the breweries in Port Moody. Definitely worth a try!</p>

                        <p>Food is top notch and service is quick.  The short rib soup and seafood pancake are 
                        must haves.  Itâ€™s now part of our weekly take out rotation!  You will not be disappointed &#128077;</p>

                        <p>Taste was 100% authentic and tasty! The soups were on point and the seafood pancake was 
                        perfectly crispy outside while still soft inside. Only slight downside was service was a bit 
                        lacking.</p>

                        <p>Our first visit after getting a recommendation from a friend.. service was quick and simple menu 
                        with great soup choices. We were lucky to get there early as there was a line up when we left.. will be back.</p>

                    <p>Every time I miss Korean food (from Korea) .. I go to Tang Maru. They have excellent 
                        traditional Korean food. The soups are always perfectly SIZZLING hot and the stone pot RICE 
                        is excellent as well! If you want some authentic hearty yummy Korean food at a decent price .. 
                        Tang Maru is the place to go.  The interior may not be top notch but the food definitely makes 
                        up for it.</p>

                        <p>This time we ordered bibimbap, solong tang and spicy pork rice. And for stone rice bowls, they come with a small bowl of solo

                        <p>Washroom's clean, servers are nice, and my korean friend said it tasted pretty authentic to him &#128522;</p>

                        <p>Unexpectedly ended up here and was pleasantly surprised. It was quite busy when we showed up, but we wrote our names 
                        down and what we wanted to order. By the time we sat down, the food came quickly after. I had a feeling it was going to be 
                        a good meal, considering that most of the customers were Korean. And our meal ended up being delicious. We tried the beef 
                        short rib soup (#3) and the mixed stone bowl rice (#12). Both were tasty. The broth for the soup was delicious, and it didn't 
                        feel heavy at all. The pieces of beef were tender and I liked how they had some clear noodles. The rice that came with it was 
                        served in a stone bowl, so it had some crispy bits, which was nice. There was also a sauce that was served with it. I'm not 
                        sure what kind of sauce it was, but it was delicious mixed with rice and the beef. It was a little bit sour and salty. 
                        They served our meal with some kimchi and kimchi radish. It wasn't too spicy. The stone bowl rice was pretty good. 
                        Nothing special, but a solid bowl of rice. However, it was served with some bone broth, which was a nice addition to the meal. 
                        Overall, I was really satisfied with the meal and I would definitely come back for the beef short rib soup.</p>
